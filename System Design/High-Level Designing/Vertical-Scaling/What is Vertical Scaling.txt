Vertical scaling, referred to as “scale up”, means the process of adding more power (CPU,RAM, etc.) to your servers. 
Horizontal scaling, referred to as “scale-out”, allows you to scale by adding more servers into your pool of resources.
When traffic is low, vertical scaling is a great option, and the simplicity of vertical scaling is its main advantage.
Unfortunately, it comes with serious limitations.
• Vertical scaling has a hard limit. It is impossible to add unlimited CPU and memory to a single server.
• Vertical scaling does not have failover and redundancy. If one server goes down, the website/app goes down with it completely.
